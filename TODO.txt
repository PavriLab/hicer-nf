Parallelize deduplication by splitting filtered reads by chromosome for each sample

Sequencing order of reads is arbitrary (i.e. the chance of either read of a
pair getting sequenced first is roughly 50/50, thus the file splitting needs to
comply to a consistent read order to account for this e.g. sorting by chromosome
and position)

Integrating this splitting via the catSam stage such that we just parse over
all split files and write the read pairs to the respective temporary files
this saves one iteration of going through the whole
