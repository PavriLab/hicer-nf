Parallelize deduplication by splitting filtered reads by chromosome for each sample
Sequencing order of reads is arbitrary (i.e. the chance of either read of a
pair getting sequenced first is roughly 50/50, thus the file splitting needs to
comply to a consistent read order to account for this e.g. sorting by chromosome
and position)
